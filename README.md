# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that explores and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It covers confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and time.

---

## üìå Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time-based trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends using charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a clear, visual report

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / Google Colab 
- `pandas` ‚Äì Data handling
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` ‚Äì Static visualizations
- `plotly` ‚Äì Interactive maps and charts
- `geopandas` *(optional)* ‚Äì Advanced geographic mapping

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### üü¢ Option 1: Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

No setup required. Just open in your browser and run:

üëâ [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/N-Segecha/COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker/blob/main/COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker_Enhanced.ipynb)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Upload the `owid-covid-data.csv` file to the Colab environment when prompted, or modify the notebook to load from a URL.

---

### üíª Option 2: Run Locally (VS Code or Jupyter)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-19-global-data-tracker.git
   ``` 
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd covid-19-global-data-tracker
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the notebook:
   - With Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook covid_tracker.ipynb
   ```
   - Or open directly in VS Code (with Jupyter extension)

5. Download the dataset (owid-covid-data.csv) from
    Our World in Data and save it in the project folder.
6. Run all cells to view the analysis, charts, and insights.
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Interactive Plotly maps may not render properly on GitHub. Use Jupyter locally or Google Colab for full interactivity.
   
## üìà Key Insights
- Countries like the USA, India, and Brazil have the highest reported cases.

- Vaccination rates vary significantly across regions, with some countries achieving over 70% coverage while others lag far behind.

- Interactive maps provide a clear view of case density and vaccine rollout globally.

- There are visible correlations between vaccine rollout timing and reduced death rates in some countries.
