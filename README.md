# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project that explores and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It covers confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and time.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time-based trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends using charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a clear, visual report

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- `pandas` – Data handling
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` – Static visualizations
- `plotly` – Interactive maps and charts
- `geopandas` *(optional)* – Advanced geographic mapping

## 📈 Key Insights
- Countries like the USA, India, and Brazil have the highest reported cases.

- Vaccination rates vary significantly across regions, with some countries achieving over 70% coverage while others lag far behind.

- Interactive maps provide a clear view of case density and vaccine rollout globally.

- There are visible correlations between vaccine rollout timing and reduced death rates in some countries.
